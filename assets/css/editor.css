/* Editor Styles for DadeCore Theme */

/*
The primary purpose of this file is to ensure that the editor experience
matches the front-end experience as closely as possible.

Many global styles (colors, typography, layout widths) are automatically
applied by WordPress based on theme.json settings. The CSS variables
defined in inc/customizer.php (e.g., --dadecore-primary-color) are also
made available to the editor.

This file should be used for:
1. Overriding or fine-tuning styles if the automatic application isn't perfect.
2. Styling editor-specific wrapper elements if needed.
3. Ensuring customizer-driven font choices are correctly applied if theme.json
   defaults or block-specific styles override them too aggressively.
*/

/* Apply Customizer font choices to the main editor wrapper and headings.
   This helps ensure that the base font settings from the Customizer are
   respected, even if individual blocks or theme.json settings try to
   override them at a global level within the editor. Using !important
   can be necessary if theme.json styles are too specific. */
.editor-styles-wrapper {
    font-family: var(--dadecore-body-font-family);
}

.editor-styles-wrapper h1,
.editor-styles-wrapper h2,
.editor-styles-wrapper h3,
.editor-styles-wrapper h4,
.editor-styles-wrapper h5,
.editor-styles-wrapper h6 {
    font-family: var(--dadecore-heading-font-family);
}

/* Apply Customizer primary color to links within the editor */
.editor-styles-wrapper a {
    color: var(--dadecore-primary-color);
}

/*
  It's generally recommended to let theme.json handle content widths
  (contentSize, wideSize) as WordPress uses these to style the editor area.
  If you need to override these specifically for the editor wrapper visuals:

  .editor-styles-wrapper {
    max-width: var(--wp--style--global--content-size); // Example using theme.json generated var
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
  }
*/

/*
  If you have specific CSS for elements that look different in the editor
  than on the front-end, you can add those rules here. For example, if
  a custom block needs slight adjustments to appear correctly in the editor.
*/

/* Example: Ensure blockquotes use the body font by default in editor,
   unless a block style specifically changes it. */
.editor-styles-wrapper blockquote {
    font-family: var(--dadecore-body-font-family);
}
